A series of projects where data structures such as Hash Table with Linear Probing, Hash Table with Chaining, and Trie Node, along with algorithms like Pair Comparison, Hashing, Linear Probing, Chaining, Character Mapping, and Autocomplete, were implemented to understand core concepts. The main goal was to minimize time and space complexity while determining the appropriate methods for optimal performance in various scenarios.
